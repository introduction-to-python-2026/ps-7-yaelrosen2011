panda Population and Habitat Analysis
1.Data Overview

 * The dataset contains information on the panda population, their habitat area (in km²), threat level, and year, spanning from 1980 to 2024. The key variables are:

 * Population: Number of pandas in the wild

 * Habitat_Area_km2: Size of their natural habitat in square kilometers

 * Threat_Level: 5 = highest risk of extinction, 1 = lowest risk

 * Year: Observation year

2.Observations from Histograms

 * Population Histogram

 * The population has generally increased over the years, as seen from the frequency of different population ranges.

 * Most data points are between 1100 and 1900 pandas, showing steady growth.

 * Habitat Area Histogram

 * The habitat area has also increased slightly over time.

 * Most of the habitat sizes fall between 20,000 km² and 27,000 km².

3.Scatter Plot Analysis

 * The scatter plot of Habitat Area vs Population shows a clear positive correlation.

 * As the habitat area increases, the panda population also tends to grow.

 * This suggests that larger habitat areas contribute to population recovery, which aligns with conservation strategies.

4.Conclusion

 * There is a positive correlation between habitat size and panda population.

 * Conservation efforts that expand or protect panda habitats appear effective in supporting population growth.
