Dataset: Panda Population and Habitat (based on real conservation estimates)

This analysis examines the relationship between protected habitat area and panda population over time.

The data includes historical population estimates (e.g., ~1114 in the 1980s, ~1596 in 2004, ~1864 in 2014, and ~1900 in 2024)
and associated habitat areas. According to conservation reports, the giant panda was once critically endangered but has been
reclassified as vulnerable due to successful conservation measures and habitat protection. The population is still relatively low
compared to past distributions, and the species remains sensitive to habitat fragmentation and climate change. 

Histograms show the distribution of habitat area and population. The scatter plot and correlation plot demonstrate a positive
relationship between habitat area and population — as protected habitat increases, so does the panda population. This supports
the conservation principle that preserving large continuous habitats is critical for species recovery.

Conservation efforts remain important to ensure that pandas do not regress back toward more critical risk categories.
